 export const para4 = `I have been offering music education since the 1980’s, including MYC, private piano, as well as several years of formal classroom teaching experience. During my teaching career I have helped to foster the growth and development of 2000+ young children who started music lessons with me from as early as 2 years old. Numerous studies support the premise that early childhood music experiences enhance brain development and are much more beneficial than computer training.
 
 In my experience I have seen how children and their parents enjoy the MYC classroom experience. I am the proud teacher of a MYC student promoted on Rogers Cable TV (2009) who was an international composition winner of the MYC program at the tender age of 4!
 
  Many of the students do well in school, are successful in exams and auditions, and some have gone onto other performing disciplines such as the performing arts, community theater and professional gigs.
 
  I would love to share my music teaching experience with you and your family!
 
  Summary of Relevant Qualifications: Royal Conservatory of Music ARCT, piano; Bachelor of Education; ECE Training; MYC Certified; proud Mother of 4 MYC graduates, and “Baba” to 3 beautiful grandchildren.

  export const para5 = `I myself am a graduate of the Music For Young Children program. I went on to take piano lessons privately, and obtained my RCM grade 10 piano. I graduated with honours from the Etobicoke School of the Arts, majoring in music. More recently, I completed my Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson), receiving a Global Undergraduate Award for my research wheelchair accessibility on the Toronto Transit Commission.
  
  I lived in Winnipeg (2003-06), working at The Welcome Home, a mission project in the North End serving a variety of inner-city communities, many of them Indigenous. It was there that I implemented and directed an arts program for children called Kids Are Creative, in operation for over years. I worked in music retail for 15 years at a variety of locations of Long & McQuade Musical Instruments.
  
  I have taught music lessons to students of all ages, abilities, and from many different walks of life, including teaching music to homeless and street-involved youth through Sketch Working Arts in downtown Toronto. I previously worked in Pattaya, Thailand with the Father Ray Foundation, working with many marginalized populations of Thailand, including teaching music to blind children.
  
  Music education has always been an important part of my life, and something that I have felt absolutely imperative to share with others in all kinds of ways.
