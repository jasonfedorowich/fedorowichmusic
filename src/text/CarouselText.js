export const quote1 = "\"Just a note of thanks for your resilience in keeping the music classes going throughout the Covid pandemic. I am sure it wasn't easy. You have always maintained a bright and positive demeanor for everyone. Adalyn and I are grateful to be part of it. It has become an important part of our lives.\" - Brent MacKinnon, MYC parent of a graduate";
export const quote2 = "\"Michelle, I truly appreciate everything you have done for us - both me and Eric. We truly enjoyed every lesson we have taken with you! Learning music could be both 'boring' and full of challenges. But you have made it so easy and enjoyable (ok at least to me music could be boring and full of challenges). Being a student for more than 20 years and teaching many courses for a few years as a professor now, I do know you are a one-of-a-kind teacher who knows her subject matter, knows how to teach the same information in many different ways to assure understanding, knows where kids need more instructions, and last but not least, knows how to make learning FUN. After coming back from your class yesterday, I reviewed all the videos and photos we took for Eric during your music concerts and realized how much he has grown up - both musically and physically. I knew music will be part of Eric's life, thanks to you. I am not a musical person, but I am also proud of myself, because I am no longer music blind - I was so envious of my officemate because she can play 'Mary had a little lamb' on a piano when we were working on our PhD projects back 10 years ago. I can play those songs too now! ðŸ™‚ \" - Yuhong He - parent of MYC graduates";
